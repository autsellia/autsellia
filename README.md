# hey there!~

I'm **Autsellia**, a ðŸŽ¨ freelance artist/illustrator ðŸŽ¨!

I'm not particularly knowledgeable on writing code, though I'm currently trying to learn Typescript for my website, based on [Next.js by Vercel](https://nextjs.org/). Most of the work on my website is done by [Nick/pprmint](https://pprmint.art/), he's very talented with web and graphic design, so please support him!

### You can reach me by emailing me at [autsellia (at) gmail (dot) com](mailto:autsellia@gmail.com), (though it is mostly for inquiries about commissions, and freelance offers in Illustration and Design).
